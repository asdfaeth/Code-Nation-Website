                    <h5>IT is crucial in modern day businesses as it improves communication (between employees and customers), enhances data storage, and drives innovation. [2] Businesses today couldn’t function without technology as it is needed for research, faster processing, security, and digital marketing. Essentially it is required for business success, as things run more efficiently, and productivity is maximised.</h5>

                    <h5>A wide range of skills are needed to make digital projects successful; possessing communication, team-working and organizational skills are essential to maintain momentum and to meet deadlines. A good project manager and hardworking team are also imperative for success. Project management software and tools are effective, for example Gantt charts, Trello boards etc.</h5>

                    <h5>IT is used effectively to plan and carry out tasks. For example I am creating a website and I’m using the project management tool Trello to manage the development process. Trello helps you break tasks down into smaller steps and keep track of each step as well as having a clear picture what the next course of action is; <a href="https://trello.com/invite/b/li89Nk4B/d80d596043822f0ea756873f7280c5e0/website-design" alt="Trello board">Click here</a> for a link to my Trello board </h5>

                    <h5>However, with digital projects, there are some risks involved. It is important to have realistic goals and expectations that are not impossible to meet; unclear strategy or poor planning can result in failed projects and wasted money. Other things that cause projects to fail include a lack of focus on user needs, leaving testing till last-minute and disregarding business processes. [3]</h5>

                  <h5>It is important to select the right technology and software in the early stages of a project, this is done by reviewing a large variety of options (looking at strengths, weaknesses, history etc.). Also, it is important to know industry trends whilst simultaneously also making an independent decision in line with the purpose of the project. Additionally, it must be the most cost-effective and suitable option.</h5>

                  <h5>I chose Trello to assist me and this has helped me to plan and execute my projects efficiently. Git and GitHub can be used and are beneficial for version control, this is imperative when working as a team as there is less confusion as every modification to the code is tracked. Earlier versions of the code can even be compared when mistakes are made which minimises disruptions. [4]</h5>

                  <h5>Often, legal constraints and guidelines impact digital projects with consequences if you do not comply. For example, when creating a website, they need to follow GDPR regulations, users need to actively opt-in to have their data used. Also, there are standard pages your website must include, for example a privacy policy; the website also must be assessable due to the Equality Act 2010 and personal data must be protected.

                   <h5>As I built my own website, I have been continually using Trello (to track my progress and to stay on top of it) and Visual Studio Code (for writing HTML and CSS). These tools have been extremely helpful as I am more organised and productive, the syntax highlighter, shortcuts and speed of Visual Studio Code increased my productivity also. </h5>

                   <h5>The tools I selected were appropriate as they are trusted and widely used tools and they benefited me greatly on this project; Trello is simple and easy to use and is appropriate for this small project. Visual Studio Code helps me keep on top of errors and allows me to work on HTML and CSS in the same place as it supports nearly every coding language. </h5>

                   <h5>My final website has its strengths and weaknesses, I’d say a strength is my neatly written and organised HTML, also the animation used on my home page is a nice touch. The same HTML skeleton was used for every page which is consistent with website practices of today. A downside of my website is the structure of the page which needs work. Overall, I am happy with the website as it is my first one.</h5>

                   <h5>Further improvements could be made to the website including making sure the website is able to adapt to any screen size, also I could have made navigation easier, for example being able to access any point of the site in 1 click or less. [6] Overall, improvements could be made if I had spent more time to develop a deeper understanding of HTML and CSS.</h5>

                 <h5>Trello shows real time activities and updates which minimises wasted time and improves efficiency. Visual studio code is fast and simplistic which enhanced my productivity as a first-time programmer. There are drawbacks of Trello that limited my productivity for example, keyboard shortcuts and keyboard productivity usage is limited, also there could be more customizing features. [7]</h5>

                 <h5>Next time I would utilise my Trello board more as it is often easy to forget to update it, I would also manage my time more effectively and not spend too much time doing trivial tasks. I would track my progress every morning so I could proper visualise how I would spend the rest of my time before the deadline. I would also stay on top of my notifications on slack to stay more up to date.</h5>

I would plan testing to take place during the development process and at the end of development; internal and outsource testing will take place will make sure the overall product usability and performance is assessed.
